# *LECTURE 1*
## I. NOTES FOR CLASS
1. important questions about genes and genome and the **coding and noncoding** nature of human genes
2. Methods of bioinformatics:
- background: advancing sequencing technologies result in **big** and **high dimontional** data
- bioinformatics solve **data problems** as well as **biology problems**
- 3 steps:
  a. information, model and algorithm
  b. the difference between model and algorithm
  - model: the general structure of the solution to the problem
  - algorithm: the mathematical detail to achieve the goals
 
## II. PLANS FOR THIS SEMESTER
1. Take at least four hours a week after class to think over and practice
2. Spend time enhancing the knowlegde in statistic and machine learning
